Data on Vegetation and environment in lichen pastures from Vegan Package

The varespec data frame has 24 rows and 44 columns. Columns are estimated cover values of 44 species. The variable names are formed from the scientific names, and are self explanatory for anybody familiar with the vegetation type. The varechem data frame has 24 rows and 14 columns, giving the soil characteristics of the very same sites as in the varespec data frame. The chemical measurements have obvious names. Baresoil gives the estimated cover of bare soil, Humdepth the thickness of the humus layer.
